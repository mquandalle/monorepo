## Inlang Tab - Transparent & Fast

You can have multiple projects in your repository. By using the inlang tab, it's easy to switch between projects. Whenever you change the source text, translations from the resource files will be automatically updated. Additionally, the tab menu provides a quick overview of any project errors in the setup.

# Let's get started

1. Add a `project.inlang` folder to your repository
2. Create a `settings.json` file to that new dir `project.inlang/settings.json`
3. Install a plugin that reads and writes your messages from the [inlang marketplace](https://inlang.com/c/plugins)
4. Install a syntax matcher/function matcher from the [inlang marketplace](https://inlang.com/c/plugins)
---
1. **Optional**: Install lint rules to find errors in your translations from the [inlang marketplace](https://inlang.com/c/lint-rules)

Look at the [example repository](https://github.com/opral/example) and it's [settings.json](https://github.com/opral/example/blob/main/project.inlang/settings.json) for a working example.




#### Requirements:

- VS Code version 1.84.0 or higher.

## Plugin authors

You can configure the extension to your needs by defining the `customApi` property in the `Plugin` interface.

| Property                   | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `messageReferenceMatchers` | `Array` | An array of functions that define matcher's for message references inside the code. Each function takes an argument of type `{ documentText: string }` and returns a promise that resolves to an array of message references (as defined by the `messageReferenceSchema`).                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `extractMessageOptions`    | `Array` | An array of objects that define options for extracting messages. Each object has a property `callback` which is a function that is called when the user finishes the message extraction command. The `callback` function takes two arguments of type `string`: `messageId` (the message identifier entered by the user) and `selection` (the text which was extracted), and returns a `string` that represents the code which should be inserted into the document. |
| `documentSelectors`        | `Array` | An array of [VS Code DocumentSelectors](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/document-selector) that specify for which files/programming languages the extension should be activated. Each document selector is an object with optional properties `language`, `scheme`, `pattern`, and `notebookType`.                                                                                                                                                     |

For this example, the extension parses strings with a `t` translation function & gives the according extract options `{t("messageID")}` & `t("messageID")`.
You can fully customize this behavior.
